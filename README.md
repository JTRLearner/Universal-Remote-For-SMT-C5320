# Universal-Remote-For-SMT-C5320
Universal Remote Infrared Signatures for Optimum Cable Boxes (manufactured by Samsung)

I created this to replace a missing remote in my house. I did not add the on demand or DVR features because I don't think I will be using them in this case, but if anyone wants me to make a version with more buttons I can do that by request. I also noticed that the TV power button only works with the original TV I trained it on, so this will probably not work on your home setup. Everything else should work so long as you are using the same type of cable box.
